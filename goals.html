    <h1>Goals</h1>

    <p>My primary goal is to become a skilled and innovative front-end developer, creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impact. I aim to master essential technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, while continuously learning and adapting to new trends in the tech industry. As a 2nd-year IT student, I am focused on building a strong foundation in programming and web development through hands-on projects and real-world applications. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to meaningful projects that solve problems and inspire others through the power of technology.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>I am a born-again Christian, and my faith has been a guiding force in my life. From the age of 7, I discovered my passion for music and began learning how to play the drums. By the time I was 9, I became the drummer for our church, a role I have proudly continued up to this day, now at 20 years old. My educational journey started at Bulua Central School for elementary, followed by Bulua National High School for junior high, and Liceo de Cagayan University for senior high. Currently, I am pursuing my college education at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines, where I am working toward my dream of becoming a skilled IT professional.</p>
